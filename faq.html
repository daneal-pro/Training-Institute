Too often, however, schools and other organizations can lose sight of this, resulting in pages which simply group miscellaneous information together, are too promotional, or even avoid dealing with tough or problematic questions.To remedy this, a school should consider their audience and ask themselves what they are most likely to want from this page. A good place to start is your student personas. When executed well, they should provide you with a comprehensive summary of your main audience’s shared concerns and the questions they are likely to have during the enrollment process.</div>

            <div class="accordion-body">More than many other pages on your education website, an FAQs section can quickly become long and unwieldy. Your school may have a lot of information it needs to cover relating to several different areas. It will also likely need to consider a variety of audiences apart from just its prospective students, including current students, alumni, parents, staff, and members of the local community.With that in mind, it is worth putting some thought into how best to arrange and present this section. There are a number of possible options to do this, and much will depend on the amount of content you have. Schools with only a handful of questions to answer will usually find that a simple one page section presented in a Q&A format will suffice.</div>
